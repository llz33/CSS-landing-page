My first actual landing page!

I am curently learning programming, and following The Odin Project
to get started. This is the end of the purley HTML/CSS foundational
part of the course before I move on to JavaScript.

For this project, I decided to skew a little from the template to 
spend a little bit of time on my own design that I could have fun
with and enjoy. That said, I decided to base my design off of a couple
of short videos listed below:

Basically, I made a landing page for a strange electrical component that is
useful to who knows what target customer, as the majority of the text explaining
the machine is a bunch of technical nonsense.

I used purely HTML and CSS to build this landing page. Learning
about flexbox was probably the greates thing that I have done so far.

Heres a couple examples of what I learned through this project:

    - The CSS Transition Property
        -Required to be part of the hover effect and the original class selector
        for a smooth transition to and from hovering
    -Background Images and flexbox
        -Learned how to prevent background images from clipping, how to resize images
        to better work as background images, and how to even use CSS background images in
        the first place.
        -Learned how to place Flex items over/on top of images
    -Learned Box Shadow Property
        -How to properly use box-shadow
